Briefly explain the purposes of the following tcpdump expressions.
a. tcpdump udp port 520
b. tcpdump -x -s 120 ip proto 89
c. tcpdump -x -s 70 host ip addr1 and (ip addr2 or ip addr3)
d. tcpdump -x -s 70 host ip addr1 and not ip addr2

answer:

a. The purpose of tcpdump udp port 520 is to capture all UDP traffic that is utilizing port 520. This can be used to monitor and analyze specific UDP network traffic.

b. 
x: Prints the packets' contents in hexadecimal and ASCII format.
-s 120: Sets the snapshot length (the maximum amount of data to capture for each packet) to 120 bytes.The purpose ip proto 89 is to capture and display packets with IP protocol number 89. This can be used to analyze specific types of IP traffic, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) packets.

c. The purpose of tcpdump -x -s 70 host ip addr1 and (ip addr2 or ip addr3) is to capture and display packets that are being sent to or from the host with the IP address ip addr1, and either ip addr2 or ip addr3. This can be used to monitor the network traffic between specific hosts and analyze their communication.

d. The purpose of tcpdump -x -s 70 host ip addr1 and not ip addr2 is to capture and display packets that are being sent to or from the host with the IP address ip addr1, excluding packets involving the IP address ip addr2. This can be used to filter out specific traffic from the analysis, focusing only on the desired communication between the host and other devices.
